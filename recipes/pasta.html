    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pasta is a versatile and beloved staple in Italian cuisine, made primarily from wheat flour, water, and sometimes eggs. It comes in various shapes and sizes, each serving a unique purpose in different dishes. From long strands like spaghetti and fettuccine to tubular forms like penne and rigatoni, pasta is known for its ability to pair with a wide range of sauces. Traditionally, pasta is boiled until al dente (firm to the bite), then combined with a variety of sauces, such as rich tomato-based marinara, creamy Alfredo, or pesto made from fresh basil and olive oil. Its neutral flavor allows it to absorb and complement the bold flavors of meats, cheeses, vegetables, and seasonings.</p>
        <p>Beyond its traditional Italian roots, pasta has become a global favorite, with endless variations. It is often featured in comfort dishes like baked ziti or lasagna, but it also finds its place in more modern and fusion cuisine. Gluten-free versions, made from alternative flours like rice or chickpeas, have also become popular, catering to dietary restrictions. Whether served as a simple bowl of spaghetti with olive oil and garlic or in a complex dish with seafood and saffron, pasta remains a symbol of both simplicity and sophistication in the culinary world.</p>
